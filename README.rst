prsannots
=========

prsannots is a Python script that lets you save versions of PDF files
that you've annotated on your Sony PRS-T1 ereader.  Currently, it only
supports freehand annotations on the page itself, not annotations of
highlighted passages, but we hope to improve this.

Usage
-----
Invoke the script with the mount point of your ereader as the argument::

  prsannots.py /path/to/ereader

On my Ubuntu Linux system, this mount point is ``/media/READER``. You'll
be presented with a list of all PDF files with annotations on the
ereader; select the one you want and optionally specify the filename to
save it as.  The script will exit after creating the annotated PDF file.

Requirements
------------
You'll need some version of Python 2.  Thus far, prsannots has only been
tested on 2.7, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on previous
versions.  It is not compatible with Python 3.

In addition to the standard library, it requires the pyPdf_ and
ReportLab_ libraries.  For Debian-based systems, these are provided by
the ``python-pypdf`` and ``python-reportlab`` packages.  prsannots also
makes use of a modified version of svglib_, but this is shipped with the
script.

.. _pyPDF: http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/
.. _ReportLab: http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/
.. _svglib: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/svglib/

This script has been developed and tested in Linux, but it should work
on any other operating system that can meet the above requirements.
I wouldn't be surprised if there were path problems on Windows; please
let me know and they should be fixable.

Right now, only the Sony PRS-T1 is supported, because that's what I have.
I would not be surprised if other Sony ereaders used similar schemes for
their annotations, and I'm happy to add support for them if someone
provides the gritty details.  I don't know about other brands.

Installation
------------
The best way to get prsannots is by cloning the git repository::

  git clone git://github.com/rschroll/prsannots.git

Alternatively, you can download and unpack the zipball_.
